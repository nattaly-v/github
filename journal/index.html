                    <p>This article goes over how the way we design digital forms is an important component of user experience. I agree with the idea that to create more effective forms, we need to consider using the "Less is More" theory to keep users engaged and make it easier for them to navigate by reducing the mental load. I really like the strategy of having multiple steps to reduce the creation of large, unattractive forms. To me, labels are very important, and the article reinforces my belief that they are the true navigators for users when filling out a form. The different features, such as the position, proximity, and inline form fields, are the key features we as designers have to make functional to make our forms work as a tool rather than a burden. To me, a good example of this is the Ticketmaster sign-up form. I think that is functional and simple for users to fill out. It's not overly complicated, which means it follows the "Less is More" theory, as the article mentioned. </p>
